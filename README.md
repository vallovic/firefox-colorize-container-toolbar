# Colorize Container Toolbar - Light & Dark Themes

Firefox extension to automatically colorize browser toolbar by matching the color of the active container tab.

Strictly, it only colorizes toolbar (and urlbar) and nothing else. Keeps consistent across theme changes and works with light and dark themes.

+ Code modified from [n0rad](https://gitlab.com/n0rad/firefox-container-color-toolbar) version (which was a fork from [Sean Hugo's](https://gitlab.com/CharoSW/containers-theme))

+ Icon modified from [Containerise](https://github.com/kintesh/containerise) version
